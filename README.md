# Dockerfiles
Welcome to my world! Here are Dockerfiles for [my dotfiles](https://github.com/tamago3keran/dotfiles) based on dark powered neovim plugins made by [Shougo](https://github.com/Shougo). I have prepared [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tamago3keran/dotfiles/general) so that you can use dark power immediately.
